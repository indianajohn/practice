STL Vector
==========
The elements of STL vector I plan to implement.

* Constant-time element access

* Amortized time growth with `vector.push_back()`

* Compatibility with STL algorithms through implementation of
  iterators.

* `push_back(val)`, `operator[]`, `size()`, `resize(sz)`, 
  `allocate(sz), the most useful constructors.
